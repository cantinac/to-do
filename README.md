# Overview

A simple todo app built for the Cantina code test.

## Live demo

The code has been pushed to the Github Page branch and can be found here: http://francoislaberge.github.io/to-do/

## Features

  * Built with Ember.js
  * Todos are persisted with localStorage
  * Includes a custom web font (that hopefully matches the mockups as closely as possible. Which font was that?)
  * Simple responsive design (as per mockup, mobile screens equal and smaller than 320px have a more lean todo adding button and no padding/margins around the list)
  * You can delete items by tapping on the right of todo items
  * You can inline edit todo items by double clicking on them
