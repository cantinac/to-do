
For my to-do app, I used Angular.js and Twitter Bootstrap.  Apologies for the delayed submission- This was my first application built with Angular, and it took a while for me to get a hang of (that being said, it is extraordinarily useful).

Also, for some reason, my git user was set as a former coworker of mine.  Just a heads up in case you see any commits by Ian Gustafsson and get confused.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this code test.

When you are ready to get started:
* Fork this git repository (https://github.com/cantinac/to-do) into your own GitHub account.
* Build a client side to-do application based on the mockups in the repo.
* Submit a pull request back to the main repository with the finished app.


Some guidelines
* The app should be fully responsive. It should support Desktop, Tablet (landscape and portrait), and Phone (landscape and portrait).
* The app should be built using only client side technologies.
* The users of the app should be able to add new todos and mark them as complete.
* You can use any library or framework that is not jQuery.
* We'll be looking at the quality of the finished app as well as the amount of time that it took to you to build it.
