A demo client-side todo app built using only Angular.

To start app:

1. Clone repository:  git clone https://github.com/0restes/to-do.git
2. Load file in browser (e.g. navigate to file:///path/to/to-do/index.html) 

(Must be connected to the internet while viewing app as angular is loaded via Google Libraries).

Thanks!
