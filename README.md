Thank you for taking the time to complete this code test.

When you are ready to get started:
* Fork this git repository (https://github.com/cantinac/to-do) into your own GitHub account.
* Build a client side to-do application based on the mockups in the repo.
* Submit a pull request back to the main repository with the finished app.


Some guidelines
* The app should be fully responsive. It should support Desktop, Tablet (landscape and portrait), and Phone (landscape and portrait).
* The app should be built using only client side technologies.
* The users of the app should be able to add new todos and mark them as complete.
* You can use any library or framework that is not jQuery.
* We'll be looking at the quality of the finished app as well as the amount of time that it took to you to build it.
