Just recvd an email with "new" instructions that provide additional detail.
Since I had already spent 3 hours on the project I didn't feel I should spend much additional time.

I did clone the button color but did not make any other ui changes bringing total to 3.5 hours

I added a few things that weren't in the spec (clear buttons)
If I had the new specs I would not have done so.

Used local storage to make this a true clientside app.

Showed use of custom directive (placeholder) to show how I would use angular
to promote separation of concerns esp with regard to UI.  Placeholder refreshes properly.

Used bootstrap ui to show responsive design approach

Didn't create install files (bower, package..)

Didn't test in IE
Did test Chrome, Safari and Firefox

More time: would have written sample tests and would have improved fidelity with png
