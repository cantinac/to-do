Cantina To-Do List
==================
Author: Wayne Elgin

This app serves a client-side to-do list in your browser.
List items are saved in the user's persistent local storage for future access.

While all dependencies are included, this app relies upon
the following libraries:

[AngularJS 1.0.6](http://angularjs.org/)
[PrefixFree](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/)
[normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

It's considered a best practice to run the app in an HTTP server, however
the nature of the app allows it to function by just opening app/index.html
in your local browser (i.e., over the file:/// protocol).
