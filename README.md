Not going to lie, that no jQuery through me for a loop, didn't want to just use Sizzle, that felt like cheating so the selectors took me a bit.  I also forgot how much I relied on jQuery's 'on' method.  Thought I was going to have time to make the colors match, and add local-storage to remember to-do items across sessions, but the time got the better of me.  Spent just over two hours on this.  Thanks for the challenge, learned somethings tonight.  Hope to hear from you soon!
