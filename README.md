# Tools and technologies used

### Responsive Framework
* Foundation
  * Specific components used
      * Grid 
      * Forms
      * Type
      * Visibility

### Javascript MVC Framework 
* AngularJS



## Other Notes

##### Would have liked to
* use SASS (.scss) approach to writing the CSS - awful writing out each of those vendor specific prefixes.


##### Things that are still buggy
* I'd like to address the JS loading sequence since it ends up in a choppy experience but on reload things are happy. It also gets loaded specified upfront as opposed to the end of the body tag.
