I think this scroll element could be a reusable element if this will be a real project, then I built it as a directive.

The applicacion has only one page with his own controller, and the page is only consuming this directive.
A directive alone is in most cases useless, then added an attribute to preload some data from the page controller to the directive, but it is optional.

About the responsive css, from the landscape image I understood that it needs to be in the middle with some grey margin around, then I made that, but not sure if that was the idea.

Thank you, Alex.
